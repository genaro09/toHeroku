=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2016.03.18; Documentation]: Deleted the version zero changelog and created
  a new changelog for our new major version one, "Changelog-v1.txt".

- [2016.03.18; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Renamed all "INC" files to "PHP"
  files and changed all references to them accordingly.

- [2016.03.18; Major code change; Maikuolan]: Removed all deprecated < v1.0.0
  functions.

- [2016.03.19; Major code change; Maikuolan]: Converted all functions to
  closures to help towards a fat-free implementation of phpMussel. Removed the
  old "phpMussel_mail()" function from phpMussel entirely (this function would
  make more sense as a plugin or an extension, rather than as part of the core
  of phpMussel). Removed the update handler and all of its associated
  components from phpMussel. Abandoned the use of globals entirely in favour of
  using "use" for closures to reference our former globals.

- [2016.03.21; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved the way in which we
  can detect whether we're in CLI-mode.

- [2016.03.22; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added an obfuscation closure in
  order to avoid needing to directly call some certain potentially blocked
  in-built PHP functions that are known to sometimes trigger false positives
  for some certain potentially overzealous server-based security solutions.
  Modified our normalisation closure to make use of our new obfuscation closure
  in favour of using problematic falsing in-built functions as was previously
  the case.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/87

- [2016.03.24; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Removed references to the
  "package" tag from all phpDoc page blocks in the package (we don't need
  these, because we already have README documentation and don't use api-docs).
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/85

- [2016.03.24; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Updated the plugin system as so
  that hooks can now be registered for closures as well as functions (whereas
  previously, they could only be registered for functions; note that this
  partially reintroduces the use of globals, which in this case is used purely
  for destructing unrequired closures when phpMussel terminates). This allows
  the use of both functions and closures together (and to that extent, is
  backwards-compatible); However, the prior change of the function for
  registering hooks from being a function to being closure means that at least
  that part of pre-v1 plugins must be modified to function correctly post-v1.

- [2016.04.18; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved the error
  handling for the configuration file.

- [2016.05.06; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Support for performing lookups to the
  Google Safe Browsing API has now been implemented to a functional state;
  Lookups to the Google Safe Browsing API can be enabled by including an API
  key in the phpMussel configuration file (cURL is required in order for it to
  work correctly).
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/65

- [2016.05.12; Sub-minor code change; DanielRuf/Maikuolan]: Improved the
  "ReadFile" closure; It's now possible for developers/users to specify custom
  block sizes for file reading.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/89

- [2016.05.15; Sub-minor code change; DanielRuf/Maikuolan]: Improved the
  "implode_bits" and "explode_bits" closures; Both these closures now return
  strings rather than arrays (although these strings are still manipulated in
  the same ways as before) and both these closures now execute about ~2.5-~2.7
  times faster than they did before.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/91

- [2016.05.18-22; Major code change; Maikuolan]: Removed "compressor" as a
  possible value for "$container". Completely rewrote the way that archives
  are handled and processed by phpMussel (phpMussel will now attempt to parse
  archives using in-built PHAR support prior to doing any further processing of
  them; as a result, PHAR files are now supported by phpMussel). The code for
  handling ZIP files has been removed in favour of simply using in-built PHAR
  support, which also already supports ZIP files, TAR files and PHAR files (but
  unfortunately, not recursively). The code for handling TAR files has been
  heavily modified, but not removed (due to that this code could already handle
  and process TAR files recursively; in-built PHAR support will be favoured for
  handling these types of files, but the code for handling TAR files will be
  used nonetheless when dealing with recursive TARs). Two new closures have
  been added to the functions file [/vault/functions.php]; "BuildPharList" for
  generating lists of the contents of files processed using the in-built PHAR
  support, and "MetaDataScan", which will act as an intermediary wrapper for
  the Data Handler whenever called from within the Recursor during the archive
  scan phase. Some minor refactoring has occurred, removing some unrequired
  error suppression and cleaning up duplicated code. Calls to "die" from within
  closures have been removed in favour of using exceptions.

- [2016.05.25; Documentation; Nadeen Shawa / Maikuolan]: Completed translation
  of the documentation to Arabic (documentation prep and markdown formatting by
  Maikuolan/Caleb, but the actual translations were done by Nadeen Shawa). With
  this translation completed, the phpMussel documentation is now available in
  12 fully completed translations with 1 other translation near to completion.

- [2016.05.31; Documentation; m7mdtiger]: Completed audit/review/rewrite for
  the Arabic translation of the README documentation.

- [2016.06.02; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to use dated
  logfiles! Now, some simple variables ({dd}, {mm}, {yyyy}/{yy}, {hh}) can be
  included when specifying the names to use for logfiles in order to organise
  logfiles by date/time. Added a new directive ("timeOffset") to account for
  the possibility of discrepancies between servers and the local time of those
  using phpMussel.

- [2016.06.11; Documentation; Maikuolan/Vy]: Completed translation of the
  documentation to Vietnamese. With this translation completed, the phpMussel
  documentation is now available in 13 fully completed translations.

- [2016.06.13; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Updated the Google Safe Browsing
  API from v3.1 to v4; Did some more phpDoc work.

- [2016.06.22; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Incorrect language data entry used for some
  upload errors; Fixed. Thanks to mtrefzer for spotting this. :-)
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/98

- [2016.06.24; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Changed the default value for
  "forbid_on_block" from false to true (this should improve compatibility with
  PJAX-based frameworks and systems).

- [2016.06.27; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Key value was being fetched from an
  incorrect array for $HookID by the plugin hooks (affected all hooks); Fixed.
  Thanks to mtrefzer for spotting this. :-)
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/99

- [2016.08.02; Documentation; Mie Shinohara]: Completed translation of the
  documentation to Japanese. With this translation completed, the phpMussel
  documentation is now available in 14 fully completed translations.

- [2016.08.07; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved RTL text
  support. Slightly improved/optimised the template file.

- [2016.12.02; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added some polyfills to
  extend compatibility with phpMussel to PHP 5.4.x (the newly introduced
  front-end feature for phpMussel makes use of the password_hash and
  password_verify functions, of which are only available natively to PHP
  versions 5.5.0 and above).

- [2016.12.03; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved mechanism for making
  determinations between requests via direct access and requests via hooks.

- [2017.02.11; Major code change; Maikuolan]: Successfully completed building
  the front-end for phpMussel! Using the phpMussel front-end, you can update
  phpMussel directly from your browser, install/uninstall/update components,
  signature files, and language packs, and more; You can modify core phpMussel
  files, upload new files to your vault, view and download logfiles, and via
  the accounts page, selectively grant access to others either to administrate
  phpMussel on your behalf, or to a more limited degree, to access the
  phpMussel logfiles directly from their browser; And you can update the
  phpMussel configuration directly from your browser, too. Front-end access is
  disabled by default for security reasons, but you can enable it via the
  relevant newly created configuration directives pertaining to it. Completely
  rewrote the configuration handler: Fallbacks aren't hardcoded with PHP at the
  time of loading the configuration file anymore; Fallbacks are now determined
  via a separate configuration defaults file written using YAML. Completely
  dropped support for users overriding the default language specification until
  further notice, and dropped the "lang_override" configuration directive (too
  buggy at the moment; may reintroduce this feature back again later). Slightly
  improved the template files. Completely removed support for archive metadata
  signatures; This was long overdue, seeing as they'd already long since been
  deprecated and removed from the ClamAV signatures set. Any relevant
  signatures, where still applicable, have been converted to CoEx signatures.
  Completely removed support for XML/XDP chunk signatures; They were unlikely
  to be developed any further and were essentially irrelevant at this point
  anyhow (associated vulnerabilities since patched, nothing new emerging, etc).
  Testfiles for removed signature formats removed from the main repository (not
  relevant anymore). Components files added/modified in order to better support
  the newly completed front-end and to better accommodate changes to the
  updates feature. Completely rewrote the scan process and completely rewrote
  how all signatures are interpreted/read/used/etc. Major refactoring. Improved
  future compatibility with PHP => 8 ("each" function has been identified as
  targetted for deprecation as of PHP 7.2.0). Temporarily dropped support for
  whitelist signatures (this will be reintroduced again later). This update is
  NOT backwards compatible with previous versions/commits for phpMussel.

- [2017.02.11; Signatures; Maikuolan]: IMPORTANT! Henceforth, phpMussel
  signature files won't be included in the main repository nor in the package
  downloads. In the future, phpMussel signature files can be installed either
  via the front-end updates page, or via downloading from a separate, newly
  created repository, located at "github.com/phpMussel/Signatures", manually
  installing/uploading to the vault, and assigning the name of the signature
  files to the relevant configuration directive.

- [2017.03.04; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Added front-end documentation.

- [2017.03.06-11; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Refactoring again.

- [2017.03.14; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Removing "future goals" from
  the changelog.

- [2017.03.17; Documentation; Maikuolan]: New additions to the FAQ.

- [2017.03.24; Signatures; Maikuolan]: "General command detections" now
  regarded in the same way as simply another type of signature file ("CSV").
  Associated configuration directive removed. Functionality can be returned by
  installing/enabling the relevant signature file for general command
  detections.
